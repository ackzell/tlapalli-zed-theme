A collection of monochromatic dark and light themes in different hues. Each theme uses lightness and font styles (actually, just _italic_) to distinguish tokens, rather than relying on multiple colors to do the job.

Dark themes are especially useful (to me) when working in a low light environment. The idea is not to have excessive contrast on the text, but also be able to have a darker background.

Fun fact: these are all minerals that you can find in Mexico 🤓

## Dark

### 00: Obsidian

The original idea was to create this theme _only_, which was based on the [VSCode  Monochrome](https://github.com/anotherglitchinthematrix/monochrome) theme. Though many tweaks have been applied to get it just the way I like them.

### 01: Gold

A kind-of-yellow sort-of-amber like the one I used to work with when I started with computers. Not quite as bright IMO, so gold it is.

### 02: Turquoise

This was the first one I worked on as a variant for Obsidian. I really like having this in the options and will be using it quite often.

### 03: Quartz

I am not a huge fan of pink for the theme, but I was already on a roll trying with the different variants, so why not having it as well?

### 04: Lapis Lazuli

Not as bright as a sapphire blue, but still nice on _my_ eyes.

### 05: Amethyst

Maybe the 3rd or 4th variant I worked on. Lots of purple themes out there, but a monochromatic one?

### 06: Jade

This is a greener hue, closer to those early monitors I aluded to when describing the gold variant. I really like how it looks!
<img width="100%" alt="jade" src="./docs/images/jadeDark.png" />

### 07:Fire Opal

This is a tricky one. I am not sure anyone would NOT be thinking "this is screaming errors at me all the time", but I decided to give it a shot. ERRORs are white in this variant, BTW.
<img width="100%" alt="fire opal" src="./docs/images/fireOpalDark.png" />

### Light

I thought having a light version for the different variants would be nice, so I spent some time creating those as well.

They are essentially the "inverse" of the dark themes, with a few manual changes I will be making before releasing a "stable" theme.
